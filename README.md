# discord-reminder

A Discord bot for setting natural‑language reminders. Type something like
`/rme tomorrow at 10am` and the bot pings you when the time comes — with buttons to
snooze or cancel, and optional recurrence (hourly, daily, weekly, and more).

Reminders are persisted by writing them as JSON messages into a dedicated Discord
channel, so the bot needs no external database.

## Features

- **Natural language times** — powered by [`chrono-node`](https://github.com/wanasit/chrono).
  Understands phrases like `at 22:45`, `tomorrow at 10am`, `next monday`, `feb 18th`,
  `in 10 days`, `tonight`, `this evening`, etc.
- **Optional title** — attach a label to the reminder that is shown when it fires.
- **Recurring reminders** — `hourly`, `daily`, `weekday` (Mon–Fri), `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`.
- **Snooze buttons** — snooze a fired reminder by 30 minutes, 2 hours, or 1 day.
- **Cancel button** — recurring reminders can be cancelled directly from the message.
- **Delete by ID** — `/delrme <id>` removes a scheduled reminder.
- **Durable storage** — reminders survive restarts; on startup the bot re-reads the
  storage channel and reschedules everything still pending.
- **No database** — reminder state lives entirely in a Discord channel as JSON messages.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/rme time:<when> [title:<text>] [repeat:<interval>]` | Set a reminder. `time` is required; `title` and `repeat` are optional. |
| `/delrme id:<reminderId>` | Delete a reminder you own by its ID (shown when the reminder is created). |

`repeat` accepts: `hourly`, `daily`, `weekday`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`.

### Examples

```
/rme time:in 10 minutes
/rme time:tomorrow at 9am title:Standup
/rme time:at 18:00 title:Take a break repeat:daily
/rme time:next monday title:Weekly review repeat:weekly
```

## How it works

- **Parsing** — user input is lightly normalized (`normalizeTimeInput`) and parsed with
  `chrono-node`, then interpreted in the **IST (`Asia/Kolkata`)** timezone via `luxon`.
  The parse is explicitly anchored to IST (chrono is given the IST offset as its
  reference timezone), so reminders resolve to the same wall-clock time no matter which
  timezone the host process runs in. This logic lives in [`timeParsing.js`](timeParsing.js).
- **Scheduling** — [`node-schedule`](https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule)
  holds an in‑memory job per reminder, keyed by reminder ID in a `Map`.
- **Persistence** — each reminder is a JSON message in the storage channel
  (`REMINDER_STORAGE_CHANNEL_ID`). The message ID is cached on the record
  (`storageMessageId`) so lookups are O(1); a paginated scan is the fallback for older
  records that predate that field.
- **Recurrence** — when a recurring reminder fires, its stored record's `remindAt` is
  advanced to the next occurrence and rescheduled. One‑off reminders are marked
  `triggered`.
- **Restart recovery** — on `ready`, the bot scans the storage channel, reschedules
  future reminders, rolls recurring reminders forward past any missed occurrences, and
  cleans up stale one‑offs.

> **Note on timezone:** the bot assumes reminders should be interpreted in **IST
> (`Asia/Kolkata`)**. This is currently hard-coded. See [Known issues](#known-issues).
> It is, however, independent of the *host* timezone — the bot behaves the same on a
> UTC server as on an IST one.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.9+ (required by discord.js v14)
- A Discord application + bot token ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- A Discord server where the bot is invited with the `applications.commands` scope

### 1. Create a storage channel

Create a text channel the bot can read and write to (e.g. `#reminder-storage`). This is
where reminder JSON is kept. It's best to make it a private/admin-only channel since it
holds raw reminder data. Copy its channel ID (enable Developer Mode in Discord → right‑click
the channel → Copy Channel ID).

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your bot token. |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Your application's client (application) ID. |
| `REMINDER_STORAGE_CHANNEL_ID` | ID of the channel used to store reminder data. |

Optional tuning variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REMINDER_LOOKUP_MAX_PAGES` | `50` | Max pages (100 messages each) scanned when looking up a reminder that has no cached message ID. |
| `REMINDER_STARTUP_SCAN_MAX_PAGES` | `100` | Max pages scanned on startup when rescheduling pending reminders. |

### 3. Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Slash commands are registered globally on startup. Global command propagation can take
up to an hour the first time.

## Deployment

A `Procfile` is included for Heroku-style platforms:

```
worker: node index.js
```

Run it as a **worker** process (there is no web server).

## Project structure

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`index.js`](index.js) | Bot entry point: command registration, scheduling, persistence, and interaction handling. |
| [`timeParsing.js`](timeParsing.js) | Natural-language time parsing (IST-anchored, host-timezone independent). |
| [`timeParsing.test.js`](timeParsing.test.js) | Aggressive tests for the parser, including host-timezone independence. |
| [`lookupPagination.js`](lookupPagination.js) | Helper that normalizes reminder-lookup page limits (preserves explicit "no fallback" caps). |
| [`lookupPagination.test.js`](lookupPagination.test.js) | Tests for the pagination helper. |
| [`.env.example`](.env.example) | Template for required environment variables. |
| [`Procfile`](Procfile) | Worker process definition for deployment. |

## Testing

```bash
npm test        # or: node --test
```

## Known issues

- **Timezone is hard-coded to IST (`Asia/Kolkata`).** Reminders are always parsed and
  fired in IST regardless of the user's actual timezone.

> **Fixed:** weekday phrasing on a non‑IST host used to land on the wrong day — e.g. on a
> UTC host, `/rme time:at 8 AM on Monday` sent on a Monday afternoon scheduled for Tuesday.
> The parser now anchors chrono's reference "now" to IST and advances weekday phrases to
> the next matching weekday, so the result is correct and host-timezone independent. This
> is covered by tests in [`timeParsing.test.js`](timeParsing.test.js).
